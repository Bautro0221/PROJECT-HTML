                                <h4>my 11th grade, when our teacher assigned us a project to create a drawing that represented something unique to us, something we truly loved. For me, I chose to draw Senku from Dr. Stone, a character I deeply admired. I poured my heart into the drawing, making sure to capture every detail, feeling proud of the final piece. But the next day, our teacher asked us to tear up our drawings, challenging us to reflect on how we felt after working so hard on something only to destroy it. It was a strange feeling—frustration mixed with a sense of loss—but it sparked something in me.</h4>
                            <br>    
                                <h4>Afterward, the teacher took each of us one by one to discuss our work, and I shared my thoughts and emotions about the drawing. Something about that moment clicked for me. I realized that art wasn't just about the final product; it was about the process, the emotions, and the personal connection that it created. That experience ignited a passion for drawing that I couldn't shake. From that point on, I began to sketch obsessively, experimenting with different styles, techniques, and subjects. With every drawing, my skills improved, and my love for drawings deepened.</h4>
                                <br>
                                <h4>As my passion for art grew, I eventually met someone who saw the beauty in my work. She became my other half, someone who shared my love for creativity and supported me in ways I had never imagined. I was so inspired by her that I decided to sketch a portrait of her—a token of my love and admiration. She loved it, and it became a symbol of the connection we shared. She is the girl who makes me want to put in more effort than I ever thought I was capable of, and through my art, I found a way to express how deeply I care for her.</h4>
                            <br>
                                <h4>has become not just a hobby for me, but a way of sharing my feelings, my passions, and my journey. It started with a simple assignment, but it has since transformed into something much more meaningful—something that continues to shape who I am.</h4>
