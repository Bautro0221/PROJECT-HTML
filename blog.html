                                <h4>my 11th grade, when our teacher assigned us a project to create a drawing that represented something unique to us, something we truly loved. For me, I chose to draw Senku from Dr. Stone, a character I deeply admired. I poured my heart into the drawing, making sure to capture every detail, feeling proud of the final piece. But the next day, our teacher asked us to tear up our drawings, challenging us to reflect on how we felt after working so hard on something only to destroy it. It was a strange feeling frustration mixed with a sense of lossbut it sparked something in me.</h4>
                            <br>    
                                <h4>Afterward, the teacher took each of us one by one to discuss our work, and I shared my thoughts and emotions about the drawing. Something about that moment clicked for me. I realized that art wasn't just about the final product; it was about the process, the emotions, and the personal connection that it created. That experience ignited a passion for drawing that I couldn't shake. From that point on, I began to sketch obsessively, experimenting with different styles, techniques, and subjects. With every drawing, my skills improved, and my love for drawings deepened.</h4>
                            <br>
                                <h4>As my passion for art grew, I eventually met someone who saw the beauty in my work. She became my other half, someone who shared my love for creativity and supported me in ways I had never imagined. I was so inspired by her that I decided to sketch a portrait of her a token of my love and admiration. She loved it, and it became a symbol of the connection we shared. She is the girl who makes me want to put in more effort than I ever thought I was capable of, and through my art, I found a way to express how deeply I care for her.</h4>
                            <br>
                                <h4>has become not just a hobby for me, but a way of sharing my feelings, my passions, and my journey. It started with a simple assignment, but it has since transformed into something much more meaningful something that continues to shape who I am.</h4>

                            <h4>He invited me to join a fun ride, and when he told me it was just nearby, I was excited. But when we ended up riding all the way to Busay, I was caught off guard. It was tough. I was so slow, so tired, and I kept wondering why I was doing this to myself. But then, something shifted. As I looked out at the view from the top, it was like everything clicked. The beauty of it all, the challengeit gave me this new kind of motivation I hadn’t felt before. In that moment, I realized I wanted to come back to this place, to push myself further and see what I was capable of.</h4>
                        <br>       
                            <h4>After that ride, I got sick for a week, and honestly, I was ready to quit. It felt like I just couldn’t keep up. But after some rest, I had this feeling that maybe I wasn’t done just yet. Then one day, someone underestimated me, made fun of me, and that really stung. It was like a wake-up call. Instead of letting those words bring me down, they pushed me to work harder. I started training with everything I had, day after day. It wasn’t just about proving them wrong it was about proving something to myself: that I could do this, that I could grow stronger with every ride.</h4>
                        <br>                              
                            <h4>A year later, I joined my first race. I was nervous, but excited, especially because my buddy Kenneth was there with me. Having him by my side made everything feel easier. The race itself was an eye-opener. It wasn’t just about speed or technique it was about the experience, the people, and the lessons I learned along the way. I started racing more, paying attention to how the pros rode, picking up little tricks, and working even harder to improve.</h4>
                        <br>        
                            <h4>Eventually, I joined my first cycling team. They brought me in as a sprinter or domestique, and I was so grateful to be part of something bigger than myself. The team became like family. I felt like I belonged, and that made all the difference. The founder even sponsored me with gear helmet, jersey, and support for races and that took my cycling to a whole new level. Training with my buddy Nenen was always a blast, even when it was tough. We pushed each other, laughed a lot, and just enjoyed the journey together.</h4>
                        <br>        
                            <h4>Now, when I step onto the podium, I don’t just see the result of all the hard work. I see the growth, the moments of doubt, the pain that turned into progress. I see the people who believed in me when I wasn’t sure myself, and it makes everything worth it. It’s not just about the races anymore. It’s about the ride, the friendships, and knowing that no matter how hard things get, I have the strength to keep moving forward.;la</h4>
